# NoterDome Product Context

## Why NoterDome Exists
Existing note-taking applications have significant limitations:
- Notion focuses heavily on collaboration but lacks the deep knowledge graph features for individual knowledge work
- Obsidian excels at knowledge graph and local-first approach but lacks real-time collaboration
- Most tools are not designed to be a "second brain" that combines both individual and team knowledge work

NoterDome solves this by combining the best of both worlds with a unified interface.

## Problems Being Solved
1. **Fragmented knowledge workflows**: People use different tools for different aspects of knowledge work
2. **Poor synchronization between individual and collaborative work**: Knowledge created individually can't easily be shared with teams
3. **Limited knowledge connection tools**: Most apps don't effectively help users discover connections between ideas
4. **Privacy concerns**: Many tools store data on centralized servers without encryption
5. **Inconsistent experience across platforms**: Different apps for different devices create friction

## How NoterDome Should Work
1. **Seamless Creation**: Users can quickly capture ideas with keyboard shortcuts and natural input
2. **Intelligent Linking**: Ideas connect through bidirectional linking with automatic backlink detection
3. **Multiple View Types**: Same content viewed as pages, databases, or graph visualization
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Teams can work together while maintaining individual perspectives
5. **Offline First**: All functionality works without internet, syncs when available
6. **Privacy by Default**: Options for local-only storage or encrypted sync

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive**: New users should understand core concepts within minutes
2. **Efficient**: Power users should be able to work primarily with keyboard
3. **Fast**: All operations should be responsive regardless of data size
4. **Connected**: Users should easily discover relationships between their ideas
5. **Flexible**: Different types of knowledge work should be supported
6. **Trustworthy**: Users should feel confident their data is secure and under their control
