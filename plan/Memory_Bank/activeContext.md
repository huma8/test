# NoterDome Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Currently setting up the project structure and initial documentation for NoterDome. Establishing the core architecture pattern based on the PRD requirements and preparing for initial development phases.

## Recent Changes
- Created initial PRD documentation (1Unified Ultimate PRD.md)
- Set up task structure for multiple teams (Design, Engineering, QA, etc.)
- Created Multi-Agent PRD Router configuration
- Established Vibe Coding Agent Prompt for NoterDome
- Initialized Memory Bank structure

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of core editor functionality
2. Set up development environment and initial project scaffolding
3. Implement basic note creation and storage functionality
4. Establish sync mechanism between client and server

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Editor choice: TipTap vs ProseMirror for rich text editing
- Real-time sync approach: WebSocket implementation details
- Database schema for notes, links, and metadata
- Frontend architecture: Component structure and state management

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Follow React best practices with TypeScript
- Use modular, component-based architecture
- Prioritize performance with virtualization for large datasets
- Implement comprehensive error handling and offline support
- Maintain accessibility standards throughout

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The multi-agent approach allows for parallel development of different components
- Memory Bank documentation is critical for maintaining context across sessions
- The PRD structure provides clear direction for development phases
- Task breakdown by department ensures accountability and progress tracking
