# QWEN.md - NoterDome Project Context

## Project Overview

NoterDome is a modern, powerful note-taking application that combines the best of Notion's collaboration and Obsidian's knowledge management in a beautiful, intuitive interface. It is designed to be your "second brain" - a unified workspace where ideas flow freely, knowledge connects naturally, and teams collaborate seamlessly.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **Editor**: ProseMirror or TipTap for rich text editing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (evident in HTML files)
- **UI Components**: Generated via Stitch AI, to be converted to modular React components

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, S3-compatible storage for files
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (Socket.io) for collaboration and sync
- **Search**: Elasticsearch or MeiliSearch for full-text search

### Deployment
- Desktop: Electron
- Mobile: React Native
- Browser Extension: Web Clipper
- Cross-platform: Progressive Web App

## Design Philosophy

1. **Clarity Over Complexity**: Every feature should be intuitive and discoverable
2. **Performance First**: Fast page loads, instant search, smooth animations
3. **Local-First**: Data lives on your device; sync is an enhancement, not a requirement
4. **Keyboard-Driven**: Power users should navigate entirely via keyboard
5. **Beautiful by Default**: No configuration needed to look great
6. **Extensible**: Plugin system allows customization without bloating core

## Key Features

### Core Features (Tier 1)
- Rich Text Editor with markdown support
- Smart Organization with folders, tags, and search
- Cross-Platform with native apps
- Real-Time Sync
- Media Embedding
- Theme System

### Power Features (Tier 2)
- Bidirectional Linking
- Database Views (table, board, gallery, calendar)
- Collaboration tools
- Web Clipper

- Export Flexibility

### Advanced Features (Tier 3)
- Graph View for visualization
- AI Assistant
- Plugin Ecosystem
- Canvas Mode
- Version History
- End-to-End Encryption

## Development Approach

The project uses a "Stitch AI to Modular Components" approach:

1. **Stitch AI** generates complete screens from detailed prompts
2. **Extract Components**: The generated HTML is analyzed and converted into modular React components
3. **Create Component Library**: Components are organized in atomic and composite levels
4. **Compose Screens**: Future screens are built using existing components
5. **Maintain Design System**: Components form a reusable design system

### Component Structure (Planned)

## Working with This Project

When working on this project, you'll primarily be:
1. Using the detailed screen prompts in the plan directory to generate screens via Stitch AI
2. Converting the generated HTML into modular, reusable React components
3. Building out the application using the component library approach
4. Following the design philosophy of clarity, performance, and beautiful defaults
